# caffe 编译

Install some dependencies：

For mac：

```
$ brew install -vd snappy leveldb gflags glog szip lmdb
$ brew tap homebrew/science
$ brew install hdf5 opencv
```



```
$ git clone https://github.com/BVLC/caffe.git
```

Then:

```
$ cd caffe
$ cp Makefile.config.example Makefile.config
```

Then edit the `Makefile.config`:

There are some important options:

- with GPU support:

    ```
    # CPU-only switch (uncomment to build without GPU support).
    # CPU_ONLY := 1
    ```


## Example for `Makefile.config`

This is my `caffe/Makefile.config` in a server with GPU, and compile with Python2.7 of system:

```

# CPU_ONLY := 1

# uncomment to disable IO dependencies and corresponding data layers
# USE_OPENCV := 0

#	possibility of simultaneous read and write

Then, I make a soft link for the two compiled caffe, so that I can change the link to the version which I want to use:

```
caffe -> caffe.py3/
caffe.py2
caffe.py3
```


## Common error of compilation：

- OpenBLAS: `'cblas.h' file not found`

    ```
    ./include/caffe/util/mkl_alternate.hpp:14:10: fatal error: 'cblas.h' file not found
    #include <cblas.h>
             ^~~~~~~~~
    1 error generated.
    ```

    solution:

    ```
    $ brew uninstall openblas
    $ brew install --fresh -vd openblas
    ```

    and make sure configure the correct path for `BLAS` in the `Makefile.config`:

    ```
    # BLAS choice:
    # atlas for ATLAS (default)
    # mkl for MKL
    # open for OpenBlas
    BLAS := open
    # Custom (MKL/ATLAS/OpenBLAS) include and lib directories.
    # Leave commented to accept the defaults for your choice of BLAS
    # (which should work)!
    # BLAS_INCLUDE := /path/to/your/blas
    # BLAS_LIB := /path/to/your/blas
    BLAS_INCLUDE := /usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.2.20/include
    BLAS_LIB := /usr/local/Cellar/openblas/0.2.20/lib
    ```

- `proto/caffe.pb.h`: No such file or directory

    ```
    fatal error: caffe/proto/caffe.pb.h: No such file or directory
    #include "caffe/proto/caffe.pb.h"
    ^
    compilation terminated.
    ```

    ```
    $ protoc src/caffe/proto/caffe.proto --cpp_out=.
    $ mkdir include/caffe/proto
    $ mv src/caffe/proto/caffe.pb.h include/caffe/proto
    ```
