## 马尔可夫链生成伪随机文本

```python
import random

class Markov(object):

    def __init__(self, file):
        self.file = file
        self.map = {}
        self.words = self.get_words()
        self.word_size = len(self.words)
        self.get_map()

    def get_words(self):
        self.file.seek(0)
        text = self.file.read()
        words = text.split()
        return words

    def triples(self):
        if (self.word_size < 3):
            return
        for i in range(self.word_size - 2):
            yield (self.words[i], self.words[i + 1], self.words[i + 2])

    def get_map(self):
        for w1, w2, w3 in self.triples():
            if (w1, w2) in self.map:
                self.map[(w1, w2)].append(w3)
            else:
                self.map[(w1, w2)] = [w3]

    def generate_text(self, size=100):
        seed = random.randint(0, self.word_size - 3)
        w1, w2 = self.words[seed], self.words[seed + 1]
        text = []
        for i in range(size):
            text.append(w1)
            w1, w2 = w2, random.choice(self.map[(w1, w2)])
        text.append(w2)
        return ' '.join(text)

测试

```python
file = open("./jeeves.txt")
markov = Markov(file)
print(markov.generate_text())
```
