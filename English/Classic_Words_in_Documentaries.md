## The Men Who Built America

> As the nation heads deeper into the 20th century, millions of Americans, for the first time ever, are able to take part in the American dream, employed in well-paid and safe job, manufacturing products they themselves can now afford. The country is united, with a robust economy that benefits not just the rich but everyone. It's the beginning of one of the longest periods of prosperity America will ever see.
>
> *"It wasn't by accident that the 20th century became, you know, the America Century. America made the greatest strides in terms of harnessing these new technologies. We simply could out produce any other nation in this world by the time the 20th century rolled around. And that clearly put us in a position to drive the global agenda. It's on the back of the Industrial Revolution."*
>
> But as World War I breaks out in Europe, the world looks for help. It looks to America. Just 50 years removed from the ashes of the Civil War, America has become a global super power. By April of 1917, the country enters the war, sending troops, supplies and weapons, resources that will help bring peace to the world. But those resources would have never been possible without the contributions of a small group of visionary men, men who sparked a revolution that forever changed America.
>
> *"America was transformed by the vision, the incredible hard work and determination, and the willingness to take big risks, that these men display. There is also no question that these men could not have done what they did anywhere else but America, because this place allows more people to dream than any other place in the word. All the matters are how big you want to dream and how hard do you want to work."*
>
> From a broken country into the most powerful nation on Earth, they didn't discover this modern America, they built it!


## 鸟瞰中国 （China from Above）

> It's a nation that recently was closed off to the world, that has transformed itself in incredible ways from a rural society into the world's factory. Cities have been built to a size and scale not matched in any previous period in world history. Across this vast and inhospitable land, high-tech transportation and highways are built at an incredible pace. Engineering solutions are required to supply the huge amounts of energy that are needed to reduce pollution. That's affecting almost half of its nearly 1.4 billion populations. Against this ever-changing landscape, millions of Chinese still observe ancient traditions and rights, once discovering new form of leisure and entertainment. China, a vast melting pot of past and present, now revealing itself to the world.


## 战狼（Wolf Warriors）（电影）(Movie)

> Those who challenge China's resolve, will have no safe place to hide.


## 造梦者 （Dream Maker）

> You are buying things from somebody you have never seen, you are giving products to the person you have never met and there're some guys you have never known that he's going to take your products to that place, to that person. I want to tell the people that the trust is there, because it's all about the trust

> Over a decade ago, a little guy from China made a great promise in front of the world. But no one believed him. In more than a decade, Alibaba has changed itself, and more and more people.
>
> 86 years ago, mankind mastered electricity and flight technology. People could not image that the atmosphere layer would not to be the highest domain mankind could reach. It's also beyond their widest imagination that the computing ability of a small chip for a cell phone would equal the world's total computing ability of the time. What will the world be like in another 86 years? What will we be like in another 86 years? What will this story about dreams be like in the future?
>
> What is your dream? Don't give up. Your dream is the greatest thing in the world.


## Zhejiang University

> Born in 1897 in West Lake, after hardships and glory for 120 years, Zhejiang University is marching vigorously ahead, infusing the philosophy of seeking truth and innovation into the Chinese land and human society.
>
> In our blood, the spirit of seeking truth and innovation run ceaselessly, making a resonant sound with the times. Embracing all rivers in the vast sea, seeking truth and being virtuous. Seeking truth to lead the people, and rejuvenating Chinese nations. These ideas constitute the mutual wealth and common pursuit of 600,000 community members. We own a complete range of disciplines, science, engineering, agriculture and medicine, humanities, history, philosophy and arts, economics, management, law and education. Interdisciplinary studies are progressing and accumulating. Elite scholars cultivate knowledge, make innovation, disseminate culture and civilization. Academic achievements serve the society, go global and lead the future.
>
> Tempered for 120 years, this land of education is becoming ever brighter. In dynamic steps and in pursuing excellence, we are creating spacious and superior room for fostering high-quality innovation talents and future leaders with international vision.
>
> Situated at the starting point of the rising Chinese "Silicon Valley", Hangzhou Western City Tech Innovation Corridor, we are not only a "bellwether", but an "engine" as well. Creating value with knowledge, aiming high with wisdom. Marching with the times, rooting in entrepreneurial soil and standing at innovative tides, we show the world a golden name card with innovation and entrepreneurship.
>
> Looking ahead with hope and ambition, endeavoring to be one of the best universities in China and the world, we are embracing the future and close to our ideal with confidence.


## AlphaGo Zero: Learning from scratch


> AlphaGo Zero is the strongest Go program in the world. It outperformed all previous versions of AlphaGo. Specifically, it defeated the version of AlphaGo that won against the world champion Lee Sedol. And it beat that version of AlphaGo by 100 games to 0. All pervious versions of AlphaGo started by training from human data, and they were told in this position, the human expert played this particular move, and in the other position, the human expert played here. AlphaGo Zero doesn't use any human data, what so ever. Instead, what it has to do is learn for itself, completely from selfplay. So the reason that playing against itself enabled it to do better than using strong human data is that, first of all, AlphaGo always has an opponent at just the right level, so it starts off extremely naive, it starts off completely random play. And yet every step the learning process, it has an opponent, or sparring partner if you like, that's exactly calibrated to its current level of performance. And to begin with, these players are very very weak, but over time, they become progressively stronger and stronger. People tend to assume that machine learning is all about big data and massive amounts of computation. But actually what we saw in AlphaGo Zero is that algorithms matter much more than other compute or data availability. In fact, in AlphaGo Zero, we use more than an order of magnitudes less computation than we used in previous versions of AlphaGo. And yet it was able to perform much higher level due to using much more principled algorithms than we had before. I think I can speak for team by saying that we are all pleasantly surprised by just how far it went, that it eventually it was able to surpass all of our expectations. It was able to climb up the rating until after around 40 days. We found that it defeated all previous versions of AlphaGo to become the strongest Go program in the world. This is all for a system that has been trained completely from scratch, starting from random behavior and progressing from first principles to really discover tabula rasa how it plays the game of Go.
