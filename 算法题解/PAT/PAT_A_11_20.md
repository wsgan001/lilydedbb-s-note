# PAT A 11 - 20


## [A1011. World Cup Betting (20)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1011)

With the 2010 FIFA World Cup running, football fans the world over were becoming increasingly excited as the best players from the best teams doing battles for the World Cup trophy in South Africa. Similarly, football betting fans were putting their money where their mouths were, by laying all manner of World Cup bets.

Chinese Football Lottery provided a "Triple Winning" game. The rule of winning was simple: first select any three of the games. Then for each selected game, bet on one of the three possible results -- namely W for win, T for tie, and L for lose. There was an odd assigned to each result. The winner's odd would be the product of the three odds times 65%.

For example, 3 games' odds are given as the following:

```
 W    T    L
1.1  2.5  1.7
1.2  3.0  1.6
4.1  1.2  1.1
```

To obtain the maximum profit, one must buy W for the 3rd game, T for the 2nd game, and T for the 1st game. If each bet takes 2 yuans, then the maximum profit would be (4.1*3.0*2.5*65%-1)*2 = 37.98 yuans (accurate up to 2 decimal places).

**Input**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case contains the betting information of 3 games. Each game occupies a line with three distinct odds corresponding to W, T and L.

**Output**

For each test case, print in one line the best bet of each game, and the maximum profit accurate up to 2 decimal places. The characters and the number must be separated by one space.

**Sample Input**

```
1.1 2.5 1.7
1.2 3.0 1.6
4.1 1.2 1.1
```

**Sample Output**

```
T T W 37.98
```

```
#include <stdio.h>

int main(){
    char sign[3] = {'W', 'T', 'L'};
    int i, j;
    float odd[3][3];
    float max[3] = {0.0};
    char res[3];
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        for(j = 0; j < 3; j++){
            scanf("%f", &odd[i][j]);
            if(odd[i][j] > max[i]){
                max[i] = odd[i][j];
                res[i] = sign[j];
            }
        }
    }

    float maxpro = 1;
    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        maxpro *= max[i];
    }
    maxpro = (maxpro * 0.65 - 1) * 2;

    for(i = 0; i < 3; i++){
        printf("%c ", res[i]);
    }
    printf("%.2f", maxpro);

    return 0;

## [A1012. The Best Rank (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1012)

To evaluate the performance of our first year CS majored students, we consider their grades of three courses only: C - C Programming Language, M - Mathematics (Calculus or Linear Algebra), and E - English. At the mean time, we encourage students by emphasizing on their best ranks -- that is, among the four ranks with respect to the three courses and the average grade, we print the best rank for each student.

For example, The grades of C, M, E and A - Average of 4 students are given as the following:

```
StudentID  C  M  E  A
310101     98 85 88 90
310102     70 95 88 84
310103     82 87 94 88
310104     91 91 91 91
```

Then the best ranks for all the students are No.1 since the 1st one has done the best in C Programming Language, while the 2nd one in Mathematics, the 3rd one in English, and the last one in average.

**Input**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 2 numbers N and M (<=2000), which are the total number of students, and the number of students who would check their ranks, respectively. Then N lines follow, each contains a student ID which is a string of 6 digits, followed by the three integer grades (in the range of [0, 100]) of that student in the order of C, M and E. Then there are M lines, each containing a student ID.

**Output**

For each of the M students, print in one line the best rank for him/her, and the symbol of the corresponding rank, separated by a space.

The priorities of the ranking methods are ordered as A > C > M > E. Hence if there are two or more ways for a student to obtain the same best rank, output the one with the highest priority.

If a student is not on the grading list, simply output "N/A".

**Sample Input**

```
5 6
310101 98 85 88
310102 70 95 88

## [A1013. Battle Over Cities (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1013)

It is vitally important to have all the cities connected by highways in a war. If a city is occupied by the enemy, all the highways from/toward that city are closed. We must know immediately if we need to repair any other highways to keep the rest of the cities connected. Given the map of cities which have all the remaining highways marked, you are supposed to tell the number of highways need to be repaired, quickly.

For example, if we have 3 cities and 2 highways connecting city1-city2 and city1-city3. Then if city1 is occupied by the enemy, we must have 1 highway repaired, that is the highway city2-city3.

**Input**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 3 numbers N (< 1000), M and K, which are the total number of cities, the number of remaining highways, and the number of cities to be checked, respectively. Then M lines follow, each describes a highway by 2 integers, which are the numbers of the cities the highway connects. The cities are numbered from 1 to N. Finally there is a line containing K numbers, which represent the cities we concern.

**Output**

For each of the K cities, output in a line the number of highways need to be repaired if that city is lost.

**Sample Input**

```
3 2 3
1 2
1 3
1 2 3
```

**Sample Output**

```
1
0
0
```

**图遍历法：**

```c
#include <cstdio>
#include <cstring>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;
const int N = 1111;
vector<int> G[N];   // 邻接表
bool vis[N];        // 标记是否被访问

int currentPoint;   // 需要被删除的顶点编号

// dfs 遍历顶点v所在连通块
void dfs (int v) {
    if (v == currentPoint)
        return;
    vis[v] = true;
    for (int i = 0; i < G[v].size(); i++) {
        if (vis[G[v][i]] == false) {
            dfs(G[v][i]);
        }
    }
}

int n, m, k;
int main(int argc, const char * argv[]) {
    scanf("%d%d%d", &n, &m, &k);
    for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) { // m条边
        int a, b;
        scanf("%d%d", &a, &b); // 每边的两个顶点
        G[a].push_back(b);
        G[b].push_back(a);
    }
    for (int query = 0; query < k; query++) { // k个要删除的顶点
        scanf("%d", &currentPoint); // 要删除的顶点
        memset(vis, false, sizeof(vis));
        int block = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) { // 遍历所有顶点
            if (i != currentPoint && vis[i] == false) {
                dfs(i); // 所有联通在一起的顶点，即连通块，都在此函数内遍历
                block++; // 所以每从dfs中出来，就计数一个连通块
            }
        }
        printf("%d\n", block - 1); // 需要增加的边即连通块数减一
    }
    return 0;
}
```

**并查集**：(判断无向图每条边的两个顶点是否在同一个集合，如果在同一个集合内，则不作处理；否则，将这两个顶点加入同一个集合，统计集合个数即可)

        x = father[x];
    }
    // 路经压缩，否则会数据超时
    while (a != father[a]) {
        int z = a;
        a = father[a];
        father[z] = x;
    }
    return x;
}

// 合并a, b所在集合

    int faB = findFather(b);
    if (faA != faB) {
        father[faA] = faB;
    }
}

## [A1014. Waiting in Line (30)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1014)

Suppose a bank has N windows open for service. There is a yellow line in front of the windows which devides the waiting area into two parts. The rules for the customers to wait in line are:

- The space inside the yellow line in front of each window is enough to contain a line with M customers. Hence when all the N lines are full, all the customers after (and including) the (NM+1)st one will have to wait in a line behind the yellow line.
- Each customer will choose the shortest line to wait in when crossing the yellow line. If there are two or more lines with the same length, the customer will always choose the window with the smallest number.
- Customer[i] will take T[i] minutes to have his/her transaction processed.
- The first N customers are assumed to be served at 8:00am.

Now given the processing time of each customer, you are supposed to tell the exact time at which a customer has his/her business done.

For example, suppose that a bank has 2 windows and each window may have 2 custmers waiting inside the yellow line. There are 5 customers waiting with transactions taking 1, 2, 6, 4 and 3 minutes, respectively. At 08:00 in the morning, customer1 is served at window1 while customer2 is served at window2. Customer3 will wait in front of window1 and customer4 will wait in front of window2. Customer5 will wait behind the yellow line.

At 08:01, customer1 is done and customer5 enters the line in front of window1 since that line seems shorter now. Customer2 will leave at 08:02, customer4 at 08:06, customer3 at 08:07, and finally customer5 at 08:10.

**Input**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing 4 positive integers: N (<=20, number of windows), M (<=10, the maximum capacity of each line inside the yellow line), K (<=1000, number of customers), and Q (<=1000, number of customer queries).

The next line contains K positive integers, which are the processing time of the K customers.

The last line contains Q positive integers, which represent the customers who are asking about the time they can have their transactions done. The customers are numbered from 1 to K.

**Output**

For each of the Q customers, print in one line the time at which his/her transaction is finished, in the format HH:MM where HH is in [08, 17] and MM is in [00, 59]. Note that since the bank is closed everyday after 17:00, for those customers who cannot be served before 17:00, you must output "Sorry" instead.

**Sample Input**

```
2 2 7 5
1 2 6 4 3 534 2
3 4 5 6 7
```

**Sample Output**

```
08:07
08:06
08:10
17:00

## [A1015. Reversible Primes (20)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1015)

A reversible prime in any number system is a prime whose "reverse" in that number system is also a prime. For example in the decimal system 73 is a reversible prime because its reverse 37 is also a prime.

Now given any two positive integers N (< 105) and D (1 < D <= 10), you are supposed to tell if N is a reversible prime with radix D.

**Input Specification:**

The input file consists of several test cases. Each case occupies a line which contains two integers N and D. The input is finished by a negative N.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print in one line "Yes" if N is a reversible prime with radix D, or "No" if not.

**Sample Input:**

```
73 10
23 2
23 10
-2
```

**Sample Output:**

```
Yes
Yes
No
```

```c
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;

bool isPrime (int num) {
	if (num <= 1) return false;
	int _sqrt = int(sqrt(num * 1.0));
	for (int i = 2; i <= _sqrt; i++)
		if (num % i == 0) return false;
	return true;
}

bool isReversePrime (int num, int radix) {
	if (!isPrime(num)) return false;
	vector<int> digit;
	while (num > 0) {
		digit.push_back(num % radix);
		num /= radix;
	}
	int new_num = 0, base = 1;
	for (int i = digit.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
		new_num += digit[i] * base;
		base *= radix;
	}
	return isPrime(new_num);
}

int main () {

	int num, radix;
	cin >> num;
	while (num >= 0) {
		cin >> radix;
		if (isReversePrime(num, radix))
			cout << "Yes" << endl;

## [A1016. Phone Bills (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1016)

A long-distance telephone company charges its customers by the following rules:

Making a long-distance call costs a certain amount per minute, depending on the time of day when the call is made. When a customer starts connecting a long-distance call, the time will be recorded, and so will be the time when the customer hangs up the phone. Every calendar month, a bill is sent to the customer for each minute called (at a rate determined by the time of day). Your job is to prepare the bills for each month, given a set of phone call records.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case has two parts: the rate structure, and the phone call records.

The rate structure consists of a line with 24 non-negative integers denoting the toll (cents/minute) from 00:00 - 01:00, the toll from 01:00 - 02:00, and so on for each hour in the day.

The next line contains a positive number N (<= 1000), followed by N lines of records. Each phone call record consists of the name of the customer (string of up to 20 characters without space), the time and date (mm:dd:hh:mm), and the word "on-line" or "off-line".

For each test case, all dates will be within a single month. Each "on-line" record is paired with the chronologically next record for the same customer provided it is an "off-line" record. Any "on-line" records that are not paired with an "off-line" record are ignored, as are "off-line" records not paired with an "on-line" record. It is guaranteed that at least one call is well paired in the input. You may assume that no two records for the same customer have the same time. Times are recorded using a 24-hour clock.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, you must print a phone bill for each customer.

Bills must be printed in alphabetical order of customers' names. For each customer, first print in a line the name of the customer and the month of the bill in the format shown by the sample. Then for each time period of a call, print in one line the beginning and ending time and date (dd:hh:mm), the lasting time (in minute) and the charge of the call. The calls must be listed in chronological order. Finally, print the total charge for the month in the format shown by the sample.

**Sample Input:**

```
10 10 10 10 10 10 20 20 20 15 15 15 15 15 15 15 20 30 20 15 15 10 10 10

## [A1017. Queueing at Bank (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1017)

Suppose a bank has K windows open for service. There is a yellow line in front of the windows which devides the waiting area into two parts. All the customers have to wait in line behind the yellow line, until it is his/her turn to be served and there is a window available. It is assumed that no window can be occupied by a single customer for more than 1 hour.

Now given the arriving time T and the processing time P of each customer, you are supposed to tell the average waiting time of all the customers.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 numbers: N (<=10000) - the total number of customers, and K (<=100) - the number of windows. Then N lines follow, each contains 2 times: HH:MM:SS - the arriving time, and P - the processing time in minutes of a customer. Here HH is in the range [00, 23], MM and SS are both in [00, 59]. It is assumed that no two customers arrives at the same time.

Notice that the bank opens from 08:00 to 17:00. Anyone arrives early will have to wait in line till 08:00, and anyone comes too late (at or after 17:00:01) will not be served nor counted into the average.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print in one line the average waiting time of all the customers, in minutes and accurate up to 1 decimal place.

**Sample Input:**

```
7 3
07:55:00 16
17:00:01 2
07:59:59 15
08:01:00 60
08:00:00 30
08:00:02 2
08:03:00 10

## [A1018. Public Bike Management (30)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1018)

There is a public bike service in Hangzhou City which provides great convenience to the tourists from all over the world. One may rent a bike at any station and return it to any other stations in the city.

The Public Bike Management Center (PBMC) keeps monitoring the real-time capacity of all the stations. A station is said to be in perfect condition if it is exactly half-full. If a station is full or empty, PBMC will collect or send bikes to adjust the condition of that station to perfect. And more, all the stations on the way will be adjusted as well.

When a problem station is reported, PBMC will always choose the shortest path to reach that station. If there are more than one shortest path, the one that requires the least number of bikes sent from PBMC will be chosen.

![image](../../images/PAT_A_1018.jpg)

Figure 1 illustrates an example. The stations are represented by vertices and the roads correspond to the edges. The number on an edge is the time taken to reach one end station from another. The number written inside a vertex S is the current number of bikes stored at S. Given that the maximum capacity of each station is 10. To solve the problem at S3, we have 2 different shortest paths:

1. PBMC -> S1 -> S3. In this case, 4 bikes must be sent from PBMC, because we can collect 1 bike from S1 and then take 5 bikes to S3, so that both stations will be in perfect conditions.

2. PBMC -> S2 -> S3. This path requires the same time as path 1, but only 3 bikes sent from PBMC and hence is the one that will be chosen.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 4 numbers: Cmax (<= 100), always an even number, is the maximum capacity of each station; N (<= 500), the total number of stations; Sp, the index of the problem station (the stations are numbered from 1 to N, and PBMC is represented by the vertex 0); and M, the number of roads. The second line contains N non-negative numbers Ci (i=1,...N) where each Ci is the current number of bikes at Si respectively. Then M lines follow, each contains 3 numbers: Si, Sj, and Tij which describe the time Tij taken to move betwen stations Si and Sj. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print your results in one line. First output the number of bikes that PBMC must send. Then after one space, output the path in the format: 0->S1->...->Sp. Finally after another space, output the number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC after the condition of Sp is adjusted to perfect.

Note that if such a path is not unique, output the one that requires minimum number of bikes that we must take back to PBMC. The judge's data guarantee that such a path is unique.

**Sample Input:**

```
10 3 3 5
6 7 0
0 1 1

0 3 3
1 3 1
2 3 1

## [A1019. General Palindromic Number (20)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1019)

A number that will be the same when it is written forwards or backwards is known as a Palindromic Number. For example, 1234321 is a palindromic number. All single digit numbers are palindromic numbers.

Although palindromic numbers are most often considered in the decimal system, the concept of palindromicity can be applied to the natural numbers in any numeral system. Consider a number N > 0 in base b >= 2, where it is written in standard notation with k+1 digits ai as the sum of (aibi) for i from 0 to k. Here, as usual, 0 <= ai < b for all i and ak is non-zero. Then N is palindromic if and only if ai = ak-i for all i. Zero is written 0 in any base and is also palindromic by definition.

Given any non-negative decimal integer N and a base b, you are supposed to tell if N is a palindromic number in base b.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case consists of two non-negative numbers N and b, where 0 <= N <= 109 is the decimal number and 2 <= b <= 109 is the base. The numbers are separated by a space.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, first print in one line "Yes" if N is a palindromic number in base b, or "No" if not. Then in the next line, print N as the number in base b in the form "ak ak-1 ... a0". Notice that there must be no extra space at the end of output.

**Sample Input 1:**

```
27 2
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
Yes
1 1 0 1 1
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
121 5
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
No
4 4 1
```

本题注意对于0的处理，不能写成while结构，一定要用do...while【同时，任何时候进制转换，为了不忽略零，都要用do...while结构】
