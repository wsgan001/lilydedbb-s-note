# PAT A 71-80


## [A1071. Speech Patterns (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1071)

People often have a preference among synonyms of the same word. For example, some may prefer "the police", while others may prefer "the cops". Analyzing such patterns can help to narrow down a speaker's identity, which is useful when validating, for example, whether it's still the same person behind an online avatar.

Now given a paragraph of text sampled from someone's speech, can you find the person's most commonly used word?

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is one line of text no more than 1048576 characters in length, terminated by a carriage return '\n'. The input contains at least one alphanumerical character, i.e., one character from the set [0-9 A-Z a-z].

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print in one line the most commonly occurring word in the input text, followed by a space and the number of times it has occurred in the input. If there are more than one such words, print the lexicographically smallest one. The word should be printed in all lower case. Here a "word" is defined as a continuous sequence of alphanumerical characters separated by non-alphanumerical characters or the line beginning/end.

Note that words are case **insensitive**.

**Sample Input:**

```
Can1: "Can a can can a can?  It can!"
```

**Sample Output:**

```
can 5
```

```c
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <map>
using namespace std;

void toLower (string &str) {
	for (int i = 0; i < str.length(); i++) {
		if ('A' <= str[i] && str[i] <= 'Z')
			str[i] = str[i] - 'A' + 'a';
	}
}

int main () {

	string line, word;
	map<string, int> freq;
	while (getline(cin, line)) {
		toLower(line);
		for (int i = 0; i <= line.length(); i++) {
			if (i < line.length() && (('0' <= line[i] && line[i] <= '9') || ('a' <= line[i] && line[i] <= 'z'))) {
				word += line[i];
			} else {
				if (word.length() > 0) {
					if (freq.find(word) == freq.end()) freq[word] = 1;
					else freq[word]++;
					word.clear();
				}
			}
		}
	}
	int max_freq = 0;
	word = "";
	for (map<string, int>::iterator it = freq.begin(); it != freq.end(); it++) {
		if (it->second > max_freq) {
			max_freq = it->second;
			word = it->first;
		}
	}
	cout << word << " " << max_freq << endl;

	return 0;
}
```

## [A1072. Gas Station (30)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1072)

A gas station has to be built at such a location that the minimum distance between the station and any of the residential housing is as far away as possible. However it must guarantee that all the houses are in its service range.

Now given the map of the city and several candidate locations for the gas station, you are supposed to give the best recommendation. If there are more than one solution, output the one with the smallest average distance to all the houses. If such a solution is still not unique, output the one with the smallest index number.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 4 positive integers: N (<= 103), the total number of houses; M (<= 10), the total number of the candidate locations for the gas stations; K (<= 104), the number of roads connecting the houses and the gas stations; and DS, the maximum service range of the gas station. It is hence assumed that all the houses are numbered from 1 to N, and all the candidate locations are numbered from G1 to GM.

Then K lines follow, each describes a road in the format

```
P1 P2 Dist
```

where P1 and P2 are the two ends of a road which can be either house numbers or gas station numbers, and Dist is the integer length of the road.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print in the first line the index number of the best location. In the next line, print the minimum and the average distances between the solution and all the houses. The numbers in a line must be separated by a space and be accurate up to 1 decimal place. If the solution does not exist, simply output “No Solution”.

**Sample Input 1:**

```
4 3 11 5
1 2 2
1 4 2
1 G1 4
1 G2 3
2 3 2
2 G2 1
3 4 2

## [A1073. Scientific Notation (20)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1073)

Scientific notation is the way that scientists easily handle very large numbers or very small numbers. The notation matches the regular expression [+-][1-9]"."[0-9]+E[+-][0-9]+ which means that the integer portion has exactly one digit, there is at least one digit in the fractional portion, and the number and its exponent's signs are always provided even when they are positive.

Now given a real number A in scientific notation, you are supposed to print A in the conventional notation while keeping all the significant figures.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, there is one line containing the real number A in scientific notation. The number is no more than 9999 bytes in length and the exponent's absolute value is no more than 9999.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print in one line the input number A in the conventional notation, with all the significant figures kept, including trailing zeros,

**Sample Input 1:**

```
+1.23400E-03
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
0.00123400
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
-1.2E+10
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
-12000000000
```

**主要易错点在于对于零指数的处理，和正指数时小数点和```‘E’```之间的数字个数和指数相等的情况的处理**

```c
#include <iostream>
#include <string>
#include <algorithm>
using namespace std;

int main () {

	string str, exp, num;
	cin >> str;
	int sign = (str[0] == '-') ? -1 : 1;
	int pos_E = str.find("E");
	if (pos_E != string::npos) {
		exp = str.substr(pos_E + 1);
		num = str.substr(1, pos_E - 1);
	}
	int exponent = stoi(exp);

	if (sign < 0) cout << "-";
	if (exponent == 0) {
		cout << num;
	} else if (exponent > 0) {
		int len = max((int)num.length(), 2 + exponent);
		for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
			if (i == 1) continue;
			if (i < num.length()) cout << num[i];
			else cout << "0";
			if (i - 1 == exponent && i != len - 1) cout << ".";
		}
	} else {
		cout << "0.";
		exponent = -exponent;
		for (int i = 0; i < exponent - 1; i++)
			cout << "0";
		num.erase(1, 1);
		cout << num;
	}
	cout << endl;

	return 0;
}

## [A1074. Reversing Linked List (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1074)

Given a constant K and a singly linked list L, you are supposed to reverse the links of every K elements on L. For example, given L being 1→2→3→4→5→6, if K = 3, then you must output 3→2→1→6→5→4; if K = 4, you must output 4→3→2→1→5→6.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains the address of the first node, a positive N (<= 105) which is the total number of nodes, and a positive K (<=N) which is the length of the sublist to be reversed. The address of a node is a 5-digit nonnegative integer, and NULL is represented by -1.

Then N lines follow, each describes a node in the format:

```
Address Data Next
```

where Address is the position of the node, Data is an integer, and Next is the position of the next node.

**Output Specification:**

For each case, output the resulting ordered linked list. Each node occupies a line, and is printed in the same format as in the input.

**Sample Input:**

```
00100 6 4
00000 4 99999
00100 1 12309
68237 6 -1
33218 3 00000
99999 5 68237
12309 2 33218
```

**Sample Output:**

```
00000 4 33218
33218 3 12309
12309 2 00100
00100 1 99999

## [A1075. PAT Judge (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1075)

The ranklist of PAT is generated from the status list, which shows the scores of the submittions. This time you are supposed to generate the ranklist for PAT.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 3 positive integers, N (<=104), the total number of users, K (<=5), the total number of problems, and M (<=105), the total number of submittions. It is then assumed that the user id's are 5-digit numbers from 00001 to N, and the problem id's are from 1 to K. The next line contains K positive integers p[i] (i=1, ..., K), where p[i] corresponds to the full mark of the i-th problem. Then M lines follow, each gives the information of a submittion in the following format:

```
user_id problem_id partial_score_obtained
```

where partial_score_obtained is either -1 if the submittion cannot even pass the compiler, or is an integer in the range [0, p[problem_id]]. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, you are supposed to output the ranklist in the following format:

```
rank user_id total_score s[1] ... s[K]
```

where rank is calculated according to the total_score, and all the users with the same total_score obtain the same rank; and s[i] is the partial score obtained for the i-th problem. If a user has never submitted a solution for a problem, then "-" must be printed at the corresponding position. If a user has submitted several solutions to solve one problem, then the highest score will be counted.

The ranklist must be printed in non-decreasing order of the ranks. For those who have the same rank, users must be sorted in nonincreasing order according to the number of perfectly solved problems. And if there is still a tie, then they must be printed in increasing order of their id's. For those who has never submitted any solution that can pass the compiler, or has never submitted any solution, they must NOT be shown on the ranklist. It is guaranteed that at least one user can be shown on the ranklist.

**Sample Input:**

```
7 4 20
20 25 25 30
00002 2 12
00007 4 17
00005 1 19

00002 4 18
00001 3 4
00001 4 2
00005 2 -1
00004 2 0
```

**Sample Output:**

```
1 00002 63 20 25 - 18
2 00005 42 20 0 22 -
2 00007 42 - 25 - 17

## [A1076. Forwards on Weibo (30)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1076)

Weibo is known as the Chinese version of Twitter. One user on Weibo may have many followers, and may follow many other users as well. Hence a social network is formed with followers relations. When a user makes a post on Weibo, all his/her followers can view and forward his/her post, which can then be forwarded again by their followers. Now given a social network, you are supposed to calculate the maximum potential amount of forwards for any specific user, assuming that only L levels of indirect followers are counted.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains 2 positive integers: N (<=1000), the number of users; and L (<=6), the number of levels of indirect followers that are counted. Hence it is assumed that all the users are numbered from 1 to N. Then N lines follow, each in the format:

```
M[i] user_list[i]
```

where M[i] (<=100) is the total number of people that user[i] follows; and user_list[i] is a list of the M[i] users that are followed by user[i]. It is guaranteed that no one can follow oneself. All the numbers are separated by a space.

Then finally a positive K is given, followed by K UserID's for query.

**Output Specification:**

For each UserID, you are supposed to print in one line the maximum potential amount of forwards this user can triger, assuming that everyone who can view the initial post will forward it once, and that only L levels of indirect followers are counted.

**Sample Input:**

```
7 3
3 2 3 4

2 5 6
2 3 1
2 3 4
1 4
1 5

## [A1077. Kuchiguse (20)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1077)

The Japanese language is notorious for its sentence ending particles. Personal preference of such particles can be considered as a reflection of the speaker's personality. Such a preference is called "Kuchiguse" and is often exaggerated artistically in Anime and Manga. For example, the artificial sentence ending particle "nyan~" is often used as a stereotype for characters with a cat-like personality:

Itai nyan~ (It hurts, nyan~)
Ninjin wa iyada nyan~ (I hate carrots, nyan~)
Now given a few lines spoken by the same character, can you find her Kuchiguse?

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line is an integer N (2<=N<=100). Following are N file lines of 0~256 (inclusive) characters in length, each representing a character's spoken line. The spoken lines are case sensitive.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print in one line the kuchiguse of the character, i.e., the longest common suffix of all N lines. If there is no such suffix, write "nai".

**Sample Input 1:**

```
3
Itai nyan~
Ninjin wa iyadanyan~
uhhh nyan~
```

**Sample Output 1:**

```
nyan~
```

**Sample Input 2:**

```
3
Itai!
Ninjinnwaiyada T_T
T_T
```

**Sample Output 2:**

```
nai
```

## [A1078. Hashing (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1078)

The task of this problem is simple: insert a sequence of distinct positive integers into a hash table, and output the positions of the input numbers. The hash function is defined to be "H(key) = key % TSize" where TSize is the maximum size of the hash table. Quadratic probing (with positive increments only) is used to solve the collisions.

Note that the table size is better to be prime. If the maximum size given by the user is not prime, you must re-define the table size to be the smallest prime number which is larger than the size given by the user.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains two positive numbers: MSize (<=104) and N (<=MSize) which are the user-defined table size and the number of input numbers, respectively. Then N distinct positive integers are given in the next line. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print the corresponding positions (index starts from 0) of the input numbers in one line. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space, and there must be no extra space at the end of the line. In case it is impossible to insert the number, print "-" instead.

**Sample Input:**

```
4 4
10 6 4 15
```

**Sample Output:**

```
0 1 4 -
```

## [A1079. Total Sales of Supply Chain (25)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1079)

A supply chain is a network of retailers（零售商）, distributors（经销商）, and suppliers（供应商）-- everyone involved in moving a product from supplier to customer.

Starting from one root supplier, everyone on the chain buys products from one's supplier in a price P and sell or distribute them in a price that is r% higher than P. Only the retailers will face the customers. It is assumed that each member in the supply chain has exactly one supplier except the root supplier, and there is no supply cycle.

Now given a supply chain, you are supposed to tell the total sales from all the retailers.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. For each case, the first line contains three positive numbers: N (<=105), the total number of the members in the supply chain (and hence their ID's are numbered from 0 to N-1, and the root supplier's ID is 0); P, the unit price given by the root supplier; and r, the percentage rate of price increment for each distributor or retailer. Then N lines follow, each describes a distributor or retailer in the following format:

```
Ki ID[1] ID[2] ... ID[Ki]
```

where in the i-th line, Ki is the total number of distributors or retailers who receive products from supplier i, and is then followed by the ID's of these distributors or retailers. Kj being 0 means that the j-th member is a retailer, then instead the total amount of the product will be given after Kj. All the numbers in a line are separated by a space.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case, print in one line the total sales we can expect from all the retailers, accurate up to 1 decimal place. It is guaranteed that the number will not exceed 1010.

**Sample Input:**

```
10 1.80 1.00
3 2 3 5
1 9
1 4
1 7
0 7
2 6 1
1 8
0 9
0 4
0 3
```

**Sample Output:**

```
42.4
```

```c
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
#include <queue>
#include <cmath>
using namespace std;
vector<vector<int>> tree;
vector<int> products, level;
double sales = 0.0;
double p, r;

void bfs (int root) {
	queue<int> q;
	q.push(root);
	level[root] = 0;
	while (!q.empty()) {
		int cur = q.front();
		q.pop();
		if (tree[cur].size() == 0) {
			sales += products[cur] * pow(1 + r / 100, level[cur]) * p;
		} else {
			for (int i = 0; i < tree[cur].size(); i++) {
				level[tree[cur][i]] = level[cur] + 1;
				q.push(tree[cur][i]);
			}
		}
	}
}

int main () {

	int n, k, id, product;
	cin >> n >> p >> r;
	tree.resize(n);
	products.resize(n, 0);
	level.resize(n, 0);

## [A1080. Graduate Admission (30)](https://www.patest.cn/contests/pat-a-practise/1080)

It is said that in 2013, there were about 100 graduate schools ready to proceed over 40,000 applications in Zhejiang Province. It would help a lot if you could write a program to automate the admission procedure.

Each applicant will have to provide two grades: the national entrance exam grade GE, and the interview grade GI. The final grade of an applicant is (GE + GI) / 2. The admission rules are:

- The applicants are ranked according to their final grades, and will be admitted one by one from the top of the rank list.
- If there is a tied final grade, the applicants will be ranked according to their national entrance exam grade GE. If still tied, their ranks must be the same.
- Each applicant may have K choices and the admission will be done according to his/her choices: if according to the rank list, it is one's turn to be admitted; and if the quota of one's most preferred shcool is not exceeded, then one will be admitted to this school, or one's other choices will be considered one by one in order. If one gets rejected by all of preferred schools, then this unfortunate applicant will be rejected.
- If there is a tied rank, and if the corresponding applicants are applying to the same school, then that school must admit all the applicants with the same rank, even if its quota will be exceeded.

**Input Specification:**

Each input file contains one test case. Each case starts with a line containing three positive integers: N (<=40,000), the total number of applicants; M (<=100), the total number of graduate schools; and K (<=5), the number of choices an applicant may have.

In the next line, separated by a space, there are M positive integers. The i-th integer is the quota of the i-th graduate school respectively.

Then N lines follow, each contains 2+K integers separated by a space. The first 2 integers are the applicant's GE and GI, respectively. The next K integers represent the preferred schools. For the sake of simplicity, we assume that the schools are numbered from 0 to M-1, and the applicants are numbered from 0 to N-1.

**Output Specification:**

For each test case you should output the admission results for all the graduate schools. The results of each school must occupy a line, which contains the applicants' numbers that school admits. The numbers must be in increasing order and be separated by a space. There must be no extra space at the end of each line. If no applicant is admitted by a school, you must output an empty line correspondingly.

**Sample Input:**

```
11 6 3
2 1 2 2 2 3
100 100 0 1 2
60 60 2 3 5
100 90 0 3 4
