## [【Lintcode】Unique Paths II](http://www.lintcode.com/en/problem/unique-paths-ii/)

Follow up for "Unique Paths":

Now consider if some obstacles are added to the grids. How many unique paths would there be?

An obstacle and empty space is marked as 1 and 0 respectively in the grid.

**Notice**

m and n will be at most 100.

For example,

There is one obstacle in the middle of a 3x3 grid as illustrated below.

```
[
  [0,0,0],
  [0,1,0],
  [0,0,0]
]
```

The total number of unique paths is `2`.

```c
class Solution {
public:
    /**
     * @param obstacleGrid: A list of lists of integers
     * @return: An integer
     */
    int uniquePathsWithObstacles(vector<vector<int> > &obstacleGrid) {
        // write your code here
        if (obstacleGrid.empty() || obstacleGrid[0].empty()) return 0;

        const int m = obstacleGrid.size(), n = obstacleGrid[0].size();
        vector<vector<int>> dp(m, vector<int>(n, 0));
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[i][0] == 1) break;
            dp[i][0] = 1;
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (obstacleGrid[0][j] == 1) break;
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (obstacleGrid[i][j] == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1];
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[m - 1][n - 1];
    }
};
```
