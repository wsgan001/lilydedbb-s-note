## [8. String to Integer (atoi)](https://leetcode.com/problems/string-to-integer-atoi/#/description)

Implement atoi to convert a string to an integer.

**Hint: Carefully consider all possible input cases. If you want a challenge, please do not see below and ask yourself what are the possible input cases.**

**Notes: It is intended for this problem to be specified vaguely (ie, no given input specs). You are responsible to gather all the input requirements up front.**

Requirements for atoi:

- The function first discards as many whitespace characters as necessary until the first non-whitespace character is found. Then, starting from this character, takes an optional initial plus or minus sign followed by as many numerical digits as possible, and interprets them as a numerical value.

- The string can contain additional characters after those that form the integral number, which are ignored and have no effect on the behavior of this function.

- If the first sequence of non-whitespace characters in str is not a valid integral number, or if no such sequence exists because either str is empty or it contains only whitespace characters, no conversion is performed.

- If no valid conversion could be performed, a zero value is returned. If the correct value is out of the range of representable values, `INT_MAX` (`2147483647`) or `INT_MIN` (`-2147483648`) is returned.



```c
class Solution {
public:
    int myAtoi(string str) {
        int pos = str.find(" ");
        while (pos == 0) {
            str.erase(pos, 1);
            pos = str.find(" ");
        }
        if (str.length() == 0) return 0;
        int result = 0, flag = 1;
        if (str[0] == '+' || str[0] == '-') {
            if (str[0] == '-') flag = -1;
            str.erase(0, 1);
        }
        int num = (int)str[0] - '0';
        int pre = -1, i = 0;
        while (num >= 0 && num <= 9 ) {
            result = result * 10 + num;
            if (result < 0 || pre > result || i >= 10) { // æº¢å‡º
                if (flag > 0) result = INT_MAX;
                else result = INT_MIN;
                break;
            }
            pre = num;
            str.erase(0, 1);
            num = (int)str[0] - '0';
            i++;
        }
        return flag * result;
    }
};
