## [263. Ugly Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/ugly-number/#/description)

Write a program to check whether a given number is an ugly number.

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include `2`, `3`, `5`. For example, `6`, `8` are ugly while `14` is not ugly since it includes another prime factor `7`.

Note that `1` is typically treated as an ugly number.

```c
class Solution {
public:
    bool isUgly(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return false;
        for (int i = 2; i <= 5; i++) {
            while (num % i == 0)
                num /= i;
        }
        return num == 1;
    }
};
```
