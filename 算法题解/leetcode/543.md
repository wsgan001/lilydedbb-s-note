## [543. Diameter of Binary Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/diameter-of-binary-tree/#/solutions)

Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.

Example:

Given a binary tree

```
·          1
·         / \
·        2   3
·       / \
·      4   5
```

Return `3`, which is the length of the path `[4,2,1,3]` or `[5,2,1,3]`.

**Note: The length of path between two nodes is represented by the number of edges between them.**

```c
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };

class Solution {
public:
    int diameterOfBinaryTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (root == NULL) return 0;
        int diameter = 0;
        maxPath(root, diameter);
        return diameter;
    }
private:
    int maxPath (TreeNode* root, int &diameter) {
        if (root == NULL) return 0;
        int ld = maxPath(root->left, diameter);
        int rd = maxPath(root->right, diameter);
        diameter = max(diameter, ld + rd);
        return 1 + max(ld, rd);
    }
};
