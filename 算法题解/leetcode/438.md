## [438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-all-anagrams-in-a-string/#/description)

Given a string **s** and a **non-empty** string **p**, find all the start indices of **p**'s anagrams in **s**.

Strings consists of lowercase English letters only and the length of both strings s and p will not be larger than 20,100.

The order of output does not matter.

Example 1:

```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

Example 2:

```
Input:
s: "abab" p: "ab"

Output:
[0, 1, 2]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

```c
class Solution {
public:
    vector<int> findAnagrams(string s, string p) {
        vector<int> result;
        if (s.length() < p.length()) return result;
        vector<int> vs(256, 0), vp(256, 0);
        int p_len = p.length(), s_len = s.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < p_len; i++) {
            vs[s[i]]++;
            vp[p[i]]++;
        }
        if (vs == vp) result.push_back(0);
        for (int i = p_len; i < s_len; i++) {
            vs[s[i]]++;
            vs[s[i - p_len]]--;
            if (vs == vp) result.push_back(i - p_len + 1);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
