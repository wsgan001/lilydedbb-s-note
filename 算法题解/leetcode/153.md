## [153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-minimum-in-rotated-sorted-array/#/description)

Suppose an array sorted in ascending order is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand.

(i.e., `0 1 2 4 5 6 7` might become `4 5 6 7 0 1 2`).

Find the minimum element.

You may assume no duplicate exists in the array.


```c
class Solution {
public:
    int findMin(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return -1;
        int low = 0, high = nums.size() - 1, mid;
        while (low + 1 < high) {
            mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] < nums[high])
                high = mid;
            else
                low = mid;
        }
        return (nums[low] < nums[high]) ? nums[low] : nums[high];
    }
};
```
