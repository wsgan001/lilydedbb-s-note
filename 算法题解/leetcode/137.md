## [137. Single Number II](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number-ii/#/description)

Given an array of integers, every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one.

**Note:**

**Your algorithm should have a linear runtime complexity. Could you implement it without using extra memory?**

```c
class Solution {
public:
    int singleNumber(vector<int>& nums) {
        if (nums.empty()) return NULL;
        int result = 0, bit_sum;
        for (int i = 0; i < 8 * sizeof(int); i++) {
            bit_sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                bit_sum += (nums[j] >> i) & 1;
            }
            result |= ((bit_sum % 3) << i);
        }
        return result;
    }
};
```
