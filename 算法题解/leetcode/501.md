## [501. Find Mode in Binary Search Tree](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-mode-in-binary-search-tree/#/description)

Given a binary search tree (BST) with duplicates, find all the mode(s) (the most frequently occurred element) in the given BST.

Assume a BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than or equal to the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than or equal to the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

For example:

Given BST `[1,null,2,2]`,

```
·   1
·    \
·     2
·    /
·   2
```

return `[2]`.

Note: If a tree has more than one mode, you can return them in any order.

Follow up: Could you do that without using any extra space? (Assume that the implicit stack space incurred due to recursion does not count).
