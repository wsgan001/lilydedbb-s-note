## [133. Clone Graph](https://leetcode.com/problems/clone-graph/#/description)

Clone an undirected graph. Each node in the graph contains a label and a list of its neighbors.


OJ's undirected graph serialization:
Nodes are labeled uniquely.

We use `#` as a separator for each node, and `,` as a separator for node label and each neighbor of the node.
As an example, consider the serialized graph `{0,1,2#1,2#2,2}`.

The graph has a total of three nodes, and therefore contains three parts as separated by `#`.

1. First node is labeled as `0`. Connect node `0` to both nodes `1` and `2`.

2. Second node is labeled as `1`. Connect node `1` to node `2`.

3. Third node is labeled as `2`. Connect node `2` to node `2` (itself), thus forming a self-cycle.

Visually, the graph looks like the following:

```
·       1
·      / \
·     /   \
·    0 --- 2
·         / \
·         \_/
```

BFS:

```c
/**

 * struct UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     vector<UndirectedGraphNode *> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) : label(x) {};
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    UndirectedGraphNode *cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode *node) {
        if (!node) return node;
        map<UndirectedGraphNode*, UndirectedGraphNode*> hashmap;
        queue<UndirectedGraphNode*> q;
        q.push(node);
        hashmap[node] = new UndirectedGraphNode(node->label);
        while (!q.empty()) {
            UndirectedGraphNode* cur = q.front();
            q.pop();
            for (auto n : cur->neighbors) {
                if (hashmap.find(n) == hashmap.end()) {
                    hashmap[n] = new UndirectedGraphNode(n->label);
                    q.push(n);
                }
                (hashmap[cur]->neighbors).push_back(hashmap[n]);
            }
        }
        return hashmap[node];
    }
};
```

DFS:

```c
/**

 * struct UndirectedGraphNode {
 *     int label;
 *     vector<UndirectedGraphNode *> neighbors;
 *     UndirectedGraphNode(int x) : label(x) {};

    map<UndirectedGraphNode*, UndirectedGraphNode*> hashmap;

    UndirectedGraphNode *cloneGraph(UndirectedGraphNode *node) {
        if (!node) return node;
        if (hashmap.find(node) == hashmap.end()) {
            hashmap[node] = new UndirectedGraphNode(node->label);
            for (auto n : node->neighbors)
                (hashmap[node]->neighbors).push_back(cloneGraph(n));
        }
