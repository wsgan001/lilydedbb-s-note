## [38. Count and Say](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-and-say/#/description)

The count-and-say sequence is the sequence of integers with the first five terms as following:

```
1.     1
2.     11
3.     21
4.     1211
5.     111221
```

`1` is read off as "`one 1`" or `11`.

`11` is read off as "`two 1s`" or `21`.

`21` is read off as "`one 2`, then `one 1`" or `1211`.

Given an integer n, generate the nth term of the count-and-say sequence.

**Note: Each term of the sequence of integers will be represented as a string.**

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 1
Output: "1"
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 4
Output: "1211"
```

```c
class Solution {
public:
    string countAndSay(int n) {
        string s = "1";
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            string temp = "";
            int count = 1;
            for (int j = 0; j < s.length() - 1; j++) {
                if (s[j] == s[j + 1]) {
                    count++;
                } else {
                    temp = temp + to_string(count) + s[j];
                    count = 1;
                }
            }
            temp = temp + to_string(count) + s[s.length() - 1];
            s = temp;
        }
        return s;
     }
};
