> The image originates from a Chinese Animation Movie —— *Big Fish and Begonia*. It gives an excellent representation to the leading character —— Chun, a girl fulfilled with love, perseverance and dream.

**One word in the movie leave me a deep impression —— *"爱一个人，攀一座山，追一个梦"*, which in English is *"Love a person. Climb a peak. Pursue a Dream"*. And I always view this word as my style of life.**

I am `lilydedbb`. This name represents my love to Lily, who has been my girlfriend since junior middle school and will be my whole-life wife.

We are ordinary undergraduate, I was in *Huazhong University of Science and Technology* while she is in *Tianjin Normal University*. This website is our daily notes, which records my learning at ordinary times. The fields range from fundamental Data Structure to Machine Learning，from Front-End Development to Programming in Server End，and involving so many many other fields.

The principle of this website is very simple. The whole website is static and I will update its content every few days. All the static pages are generated by a powerful publishing tool —— [GitBook](https://github.com/GitbookIO/gitbook), which is a Modern book format and toolchain using Git and Markdown and the nginx work as reverse proxy. Because I have been engaged in massive annoying things this few months, so I have little time to update this site to a more original version. Thanks for you all-the-time following to my notes.

All the notes were written in the grammar of Markdown, if you want to see the source codes, you can clone this book from the github repository of ```lilydedbb```:

(run the following command in the shell)

```
$ git clone git@github.com:lilydedbb/lilydedbb-s-note.git
```

Also if you want to serve gitbook, you have to install ```gitbook``` first. The easiest way is to install it by ```npm```:

```
$ npm install gitbook -g
```

Then run the gitbook server:

```
$ cd my-gitbook
$ gitbook server
```
